I have delimited the dataset provided in Excel and loaded as dataframe in jupyter notebook
Neglecting the first 50 rows, I have converted the column' VO2max' as integer and encoded into groups(named by colours)
created a dataframe by using the new VO2max column by counting the occurance of each colour and plotted the graphs
